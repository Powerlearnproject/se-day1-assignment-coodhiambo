Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Question 1:**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Answer:**
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles , methods and tools in the design,development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software. Software Engineering is important in the technology industry because:

1. Through Software Engineering it is possible to deliver accurate and reliable software to automate human tasks, for example a software that controls the packaging of finished food items in a factory.

2. Software Engineering enables the ability to continously improve existing software systems through the rigor it offers in the analysis, testing and modelling of software products on sound theoretical models. 

3. Software Engineering enables the interfacing of different technological fields and hence providing a wider scope of application o software. For example embedded systems such as software controlling a microwave cooker, self dive cars and so on.


**Question 2:**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**Answer:**
1. The Communication Age (1993-2001).
2. The Productivity Age( 2002-2010).
3. The Mass Market Era (2011 to Date).

**Question 3:**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Answer:**
1. Planning.
2. Requirements Analysis.
3. Design.
4. Coding.
5. Testing.
6. Deployment.
7. Maintenance.

**Answer:**


**Question 5:**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Answer:**
1. Software Developer Role
2. Quality Assurance Engineer Role.
3. Project Manager Role.


**Question 6:**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Answer:**
1. Integrated Development Environments.
2. Version Control Systems.

**Question 7:**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

**Answer:**

**Question 8:**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

**Answer:**


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
